With 12 years of digital marketing experience, 8.5 of which in B2B SaaS, I am a versatile and results-oriented manager who knows how to leverage multiple channels and tactics to drive growth and profitability. Currently, I lead and execute the digital marketing strategy at Memory, a leading productivity app that helps people work smarter and faster.

My core competencies include technical SEO and SEM, web analytics, content optimization, paid campaigns, and project management. I also have a strong background in B2C e-commerce, having worked with some of the most popular online platforms in the industry. I thrive in multinational and cross-functional environments, where I can apply my T-shaped skill set, my passion for innovation, and my servant leadership style to inspire and empower my team and partners. My mantra is to stay committed, stay curious, and never stop evolving. Let's connect and create something extraordinary together!
